# NAPLAN Revision Notes - Area & Perimeter

---

## Grade 3 - Area & Perimeter

### Area
**What is area?**  
Area is the space inside a shape.

**How to find area:**  
- Count the squares inside a shape
- Area = length × width

**Example:**
```
▀▀▀▀▀  (4 squares across)
▀▀▀▀▀  (4 squares down)

Area = 4 × 4 = 16 squares
```

**Key words:** inside, cover, square units

---

### Perimeter
**What is perimeter?**  
Perimeter is the distance around the outside of a shape.

**How to find perimeter:**  
- Add up all the sides
- Perimeter = side + side + side + side

**Example:**
```
────  (4 cm)
│    │
│    │  (3 cm)
────  (4 cm)
   │
   
Perimeter = 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 14 cm
```

**Key words:** around, outside, edges, boundary

---

### Grade 3 Tips
- Draw pictures to visualise
- Count squares carefully
- Don't forget units (cm² for area, cm for perimeter)

---

## Grade 5 - Area & Perimeter

### Area of Rectangle
**Formula:** Area = length × width  
**A = l × w**

**Example:**
```
Length = 8 cm
Width = 5 cm

Area = 8 × 5 = 40 cm²
```

### Area of Triangle
**Formula:** Area = ½ × base × height  
**A = ½ × b × h**

**Example:**
```
Base = 6 cm
Height = 4 cm

Area = ½ × 6 × 4 = 12 cm²
```

### Perimeter of Rectangle
**Formula:** Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)  
**P = 2(l + w)**

**Example:**
```
Length = 8 cm
Width = 5 cm

Perimeter = 2 × (8 + 5) = 26 cm
```

### Area of Composite Shapes
Break into smaller shapes, find each area, then add together.

---

### Grade 5 Tips
- Remember: area uses **cm²** (square units)
- Perimeter uses **cm** (linear units)
- For triangles, always multiply by ½
- Show all working in exams
- Check units match in calculations

## Quick Formulas Reference

| Shape | Area | Perimeter |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Rectangle | l × w | 2(l + w) |
| Square | s × s | 4s |
| Triangle | ½b × h | s₁ + s₂ + s₃ |

---

**Remember:**  
- **Area** = what's **inside** (cm²)  
- **Perimeter** = what's **around** (cm)
